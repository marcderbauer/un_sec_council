# UN Sec Council
## What is this Repo?
This repo aims to bring transparency to the meetings of the UN Security Council. It does this by creating a reproducible dataset which can be used for NLP-based research.  
It currently  does two things:
  1. Download the `.pdf` files of all publicly available UN Security Council Meetings
  2. Extract relevant metadata and text by speaker for every meeting transcript
